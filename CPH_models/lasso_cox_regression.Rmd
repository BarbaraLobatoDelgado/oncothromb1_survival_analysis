## R Markdown

```{r cars}
# Load time-dependent dataset
oncoth1_td_dataset = read.csv(file = "/mnt/ir-bioinf02/home/blobato/oncothromb01/data/processed/oncoth1_td_dataset.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
